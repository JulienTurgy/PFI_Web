Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.","Created":1608582953,"GUID":"1ebf6060-43cc-11eb-89fe-8db96bd30716","UserId":10,"LoggedUserId":10},{"Id":6,"Title":"Des aurores boreal","Description":"NIIIICE","Created":1608499458,"GUID":"b7ec1080-4309-11eb-816d-7506f6d5504d","UserId":11},{"Id":7,"Title":"C'est la fin de session!","Description":"Bravo a tous et a toutes.","Created":1608583252,"GUID":"d0d68080-43cc-11eb-96ae-fb392ec4cefc","UserId":1},{"Id":8,"Title":"BB king & Lucille","Description":"Riley B. King (September 16, 1925 – May 14, 2015), known professionally as B.B. King, was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. King introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending, shimmering vibrato and staccato picking that influenced many later blues electric guitar players.[5][6] AllMusic recognized King as \"the single most important electric guitarist of the last half of the 20th century\".[6]\n\nKing was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname \"The King of the Blues\", and is considered one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" (along with Albert King and Freddie King, none of whom are blood related).[7][8][9] King performed tirelessly throughout his musical career, appearing on average at more than 200 concerts per year into his 70s.[10] In 1956 alone, he appeared at 342 shows.[11]","Created":1608584896,"GUID":"5c171540-43cf-11eb-bd9c-17331d4ef307","UserId":1,"ImageData":""}]
